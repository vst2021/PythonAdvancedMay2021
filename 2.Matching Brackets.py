'''
We are given an arithmetic expression with brackets. Scan through the string and extract each sub-expression.
Print the result back on the console
Examples
Input	Output
1 + (2 - (2 + 3) * 4 / (3 + 1)) * 5	(2 + 3)
(3 + 1)
(2 - (2 + 3) * 4 / (3 + 1))
(2 + 3) - (2 + 3)	(2 + 3)
(2 + 3)
Hints
â€¢	Scan through the expression searching for brackets
o	If you find an opening bracket, push the index into the stack
o	If you find a closing bracket pop the topmost element from the stack. This is the index of the opening bracket.
o	Use the current and the popped index to extract the sub-expression
